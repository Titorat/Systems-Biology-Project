# Systems-Biology-Project
This is my project in systems biology which is inspired by [ Zagkos, L., Auley, M. M., Roberts, J., &amp; Kavallaris, N. I. (2019).]
I used R language for the simulation of DNA methylation process, I reproduced the results of the linear and the Non-linear Differential equations. 
I mainly used PhaseR package for the simulation.
